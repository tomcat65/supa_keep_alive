# Supabase Multi-Project Monitor

A serverless monitoring solution for multiple Supabase projects deployed on Vercel. The monitor performs health checks by inserting records into a `health_checks` table for each project.

## Features

- Monitor multiple Supabase projects simultaneously
- Automated health checks every 12 hours
- Manual health check endpoint
- Serverless deployment on Vercel
- Secure cron endpoints with authentication

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+
- Vercel account

### Required Table Structure

Create this table in each Supabase project:

```sql
create table health_checks (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  status text,
  project_name text
);
```
